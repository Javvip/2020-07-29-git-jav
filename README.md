## The basics

- 'git init': create a repository in your current folder
- 'git status': tells you everything you need to know about the current state
- 'git add <path>: adds the <path> to staging area
- 'git commit': will open up an editor to write a commit message
	- 'git commit -m "your message": write <message> to commit in 1 step
- 'git diff': diff the current state with the last know the state
	- 'git diff --staged': diff files in the stagged area
- 'HEAD': where you are currently looking (i.e., what the files on your computer are)
